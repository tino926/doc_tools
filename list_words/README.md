# List Words

A straightforward Python script designed to extract words from a specified text 
file, eliminating duplicates and excluding words found in easy.txt. Its primary 
goal is to facilitate the creation of a word list tailored for Language learning 
purposes.

## Usage

1. Ensure your `input.txt` is located in the same directory as `list_words.py`.
2. Execute the script with the following command:
   ```bash
   python list_words.py
   ```
3. Retrieve the results from `output.txt`.
